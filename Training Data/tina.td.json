        "response": "Who wouldn't be worried about something like that? Those sound like sudden and unforseen accidents and since you're worried about hitting things that aren't cars, it's safe to say you'd be interested in cover for damage to other people's property (like cows). Now, another thing I'd like to clarify is, what kind of vehicle is your 2018 Cherokee? Is it a sedan, an SUV, a ute, or something else?"

        "response": "If you meant to tell me your vehicle is a 2018 Jeep Cherokee, I can recognise that brand as one who only manufactures SUVs. If that's the case, and if you were still interested in insurance that would cover both your vehicle and other people's property, then Comprehensive insurance would be a good fit. It insures your car in case of sudden accidents, includes cover for other people's cars and property, and also comes with mechanical breakdown insurance in case any wear and tear takes you off the road.

Your 2023 Tesla Roadster is a relatively new car, and you said that you wanted cover both for your car and your liabilities, or damage you may be held responsible for in the event of an accident. Comprehensive insurance would be a good fit since it offers cover for your vehicle for damage from any sudden, unforseen and accidental damage, or damage you may cause other people's cars or property. It also comes with additional cover for mechanical breakdowns. You can find one of our staff members if you'd like to know more, or check another car for a new suggestion."

            "response": "All right. You've told me you wanted full cover for your 2010 ute, but the only insurance policy we have that offers cover for all events would be our Comprehensive insurance, which we can't offer for your vehicle since it's older than 10 years. You can approach one of our staff members for more information, or was there another vehicle you wanted to check with me?"

            "response": "I see. Unfortunately, the policy that would offer full cover, Comprehensive insurance, can only insure vehicles no more than 10 years old. You may want to consider exploring your options or speaking to one of our staff members. Was there another vehicle you were looking to insure?"

            "response": "We may be able to insure your vehicle, but did you want the Pajero _itself_ to be covered in case of those accidents, or were you only worried about damage to _other people's_ vehicles or property?"
        },
        {
            "message": "oh Yeah full cover, whichever that one is. the pajero needs to be insured",
            "response": "Excellent. Because your vehicle is a 2021 Pajero SUV, is less than 10 years old, and you were looking for insurance that would offer cover for the car itself, a Comprehensive Insurance policy would suit your needs best. This would insure the vehicle itself for any sudden, unforseen and accidental damage, and automatically includes cover for damage to third parties and mechanical breakdowns. If you need more information, please find one of our customer service representatives. Did you have another vehicle you'd like to check with me?"

            "response": "Of course. Your other vehicle is a BMW, but I'll need to know more to narrow my suggestions down. Do you remember what year your BMW is?"

            "message": "2013 i think",
            "response": "Thank you. I see your BMW is more than 10 years old. Unfortunately, our Comprehensive insurance policies can only cover vehicles less than 10 years old. Was there another vehicle you wanted to check with me?"

            "message": "Yeah this Yamaha I just bought from you guys, 2019. Like I said, I'll probably use this a lot, so I'm going to want full cover.",
            "response": "Excellent. The manufacturer Yamaha only produces motorcycles at this time so it's safe to assume your 2019 Yamaha is a motorcycle. Because your motorcycle is less than 10 years old and you want 'full cover' or cover for any sudden, unforseen and accidentally damage, cover for damage you may cause other people's vehicles or property, and mechanical breakdown insurance, Comprehensive Insurance would be a good fit for your needs since that's exactly what it offers. Speak to one of our staff members if you'd like more information. Was there any other vehicle you wanted to check with me?"
